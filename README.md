I believe that consolidating all reports into a single, unified format would be highly advantageous. This would not only reduce time spent on report generation but also ensure the reports effectively support the needs of all teams. This is a key reason why I'm interested in learning data analysis â€“ to streamline these processes and improve overall efficiency.
